\section{Data preprocessing} \label{sec:data-preprocessing}
The performance of the different algorithms is highly dependent on the input data.
It is therefore important to preprocess the data to get the best possible performance.
This section will describe the preprocessing of the data, which is done before the algorithms are applied.
Several different preprocessing methods are considered.

The preprocessing methods are described in Table~\ref{tab:preprocessing}.

    \begin{tabular}{p{0.15\textwidth}p{0.5\textwidth}p{0.25\textwidth}}
        \toprule
        Method & Description & Formular \\
        \midrule
        Normalized IQ symbols & As mentioned in Section~\ref{subsec:data_processing} the two way channel is calculated by multiplying the \ac{iq} symbols from the transmitter and receiver.
        The preprocessing to get the desired \ac{iq} symbols is to normalize the symbols, so the complex number has a length of 1.
        The input dimension is then 79, which is the number of frequencies & $Z'=\frac{a+bi}{\sqrt{a^2+b^2}}$\\
        \midrule
        Phase & The phase is extracted from the \ac{iq} symbols.
        The input dimension is then 79, which is the number of frequencies & $\phi=\arctan\left(\frac{b}{a}\right)$\\
        \midrule
        Phase \mbox{unwrapped} & The phase is extracted from the \ac{iq} symbols and unwrapped using an unwrapping algorithm & $\phi=\arctan\left(\frac{b}{a}\right)$ and Unwrapping algorithm in Section~\ref{sec:linear}\\
        \midrule
        Phase \mbox{difference} & The phase is extracted from the \ac{iq} symbols, the difference between the phase of the current sample and the previous sample is calculated.
        This results in an input dimension of 78 & $\Delta\phi = \phi_1 - \phi_2$\\
        \midrule
        Symbol \mbox{difference} & The \ac{iq} symbols are normalized and the difference between the current sample and the previous sample is calculated.
        This results in an input dimension of 78 & $\Delta z_n=z_n-z_{n-1}$\\
