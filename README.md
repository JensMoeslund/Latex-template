# Report template
This is a template for writing reports at AAU. 
The latex files are compiled locally on the computer.

There are several different Tex distributions to choose from for compiling tex. 
We recomend using Tex Live since it comes with all packages which minimizes all the trouble for you.

Alternatively install MikTex. A guide can be found [here](https://miktex.org/download)
